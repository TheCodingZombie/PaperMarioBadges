# Paper Mario Badges
A Balatro mod that adds Paper-Mario inspired badges!

## New Mechanic: Badges!
- These are modifiers that add all new effects to Jokers! From score increases, to consumable generation, to modifying the Jokers themselves!
- You can only have one of them per Joker, so pick wisely.
- There will also be ways to apply them to Jokers in the future, but they only exist in debug right now.

## Current Feature List
- 51 unique Badges

## TODO
- Add Consumables/Tarot Cards that add these badges to Jokers (selected or leftmost)
- Add the remaining Badges (9 remaining)
- Make it easy for people to add custom badges of their own!
