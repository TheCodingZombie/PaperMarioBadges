# Paper Mario Badges
A Balatro mod that adds Paper-Mario inspired badges!
This mod is an addon to the [ColorSplashed](https://github.com/TheCodingZombie/PMCSBalatro) mod, but can act standalone. If this mod is not used
with the ColorSplashed mod, however, certain badges will not be available for use.

## New Mechanic: Badges!
- These are modifiers that add all new effects to Jokers! From score increases, to consumable generation, to modifying the Jokers themselves!
- You can only have one of them per Joker, so pick wisely.
- There will also be ways to apply them to Jokers in the future, but they only exist in debug right now.

## Current Feature List
- 52 unique Badges
- 52 Badge Appliers 

## TODO
- Add the remaining Badges (8 remaining)
- Make it easy for people to add custom badges of their own!
